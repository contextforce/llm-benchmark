## Question 1
```
A stationary source emits sound of frequency fo = 492 Hz. The sound is reflected by a large car approaching the source with a speed of 2 ms power to -1. The reflected signal is received by the source and superposed with the original. What will be the beat frequency of the resulting signal in Hz? (Given that the speed of sound in air is 330 ms power to -1 and the car reflects the sound at the frequency it has received). give answer
```
* Correct Answer: 6 Hz
